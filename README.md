<p><c>This is the browser version of "Oh, How We Fall"</c></p>
<p>This is just a little idle/adventure game.</p>
<p>Inspired by many great games, but the main one is "<a href="http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/">A Dark Room</a>" created by <a href="http://doublespeakgames.com">Doublespeak Games</a>.</p>
<p>If you happen to read this, it means this game is still in development.</p>
<p>You may follow this game if you would like, but this may not be done anythime soon. Hopefully by the end of this year.</p>
